# SYNC Internship

Welcome to the SYNC Internship repository. This repository showcases projects completed during the SYNC internship program, featuring applications in machine learning and computer vision.

## Tasks Overview

The internship consisted of four main tasks, each focusing on practical applications of machine learning and computer vision techniques:

### Task 1: Chatbot Development
- **Objective:** Create an interactive chatbot using natural language processing techniques.
- **Description:** The chatbot was designed to engage users in natural conversation, providing responses based on predefined intents and user input.

### Task 2: Real-time Face Mask Detection
- **Objective:** Develop a real-time system to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks.
- **Description:** This task involved training a deep learning model to identify faces and classify them based on the presence or absence of a face mask, contributing to public health and safety measures.

### Task 3: Boston House Price Predictions
- **Objective:** Build a predictive model to estimate house prices in Boston.
- **Description:** Utilizing regression techniques, this task focused on analyzing historical housing data to predict prices based on various features, aiding in real estate market analysis and decision-making.

### Task 4: Sign Language Classification
- **Objective:** Implement a system to recognize and classify American Sign Language gestures.
- **Description:** This project involved training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to interpret hand gestures from images or video frames, facilitating communication accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.

## Repository Structure

- **Chatbot Development:** Contains code and resources for Task 1, including natural language processing models and training scripts.
- **Face Mask Detection:** Includes real-time detection models and related scripts developed for Task 2.
- **House Price Predictions:** Features notebooks and datasets used for Task 3's regression analysis and predictions.
- **Sign Language Classification:** Contains CNN models, datasets, and notebooks developed for Task 4's sign language gesture classification.
